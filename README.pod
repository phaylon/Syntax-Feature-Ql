=head1 NAME

Syntax::Feature::Ql - Turns a quoted string into a single line

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use syntax qw( ql );

    # prints on one line
    say ql{
        Do you know the feeling when you want to generate a long
        string for a message without having to concatenate or end
        up with newlines and indentation?
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a syntax extension feature suitable for the L<syntax> extension
dispatcher.

It provides two new quote-like operators named C<ql> and C<qql>. These
work in the same way as C<q> and C<qq> (including the ability to change
the delimiters), except they put the returned string on a single line.

The following all output C<foo bar baz>:

    # simple
    say ql{foo bar baz};

    # multiline
    say ql{
        foo
        bar
        baz
    };

    # different delimiters and interpolation
    my $qux = q{ # <- this is a normal quote!
        bar
        baz
    };
    say qql!
        foo
        $qux
    !;

As you can see with the last example, interpolated values are also
normalized to fit on the single line.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 install

    Syntax::Feature::Ql->install( into => $target );

Installs the C<ql> and C<qql> operators into the C<$target>.
